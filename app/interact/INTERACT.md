### 1. Connecting to a Contract

```
// Example contract address formats - all supported
0x742f4f7549B39666d7A55b3d5316e7e5dcC86944  // EVM format
0.0.1234567                                  // Hedera format
1234567                                      // Numeric format
```

  - Contract address (in both EVM and Hedera formats)
  - Creation date and transaction hash
  - Contract balance
  - Creator address
  - ABI source (detected or manually provided)

### 2. Exploring Contract Functions

The interface automatically categorizes and displays all contract functions:

- **Read Functions Tab**: 
  - View-only functions that don't modify state
  - No gas required, instant results
  - Useful for querying contract state, balances, and configuration

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Contract Address Not Found**
   - Verify the address format is correct (EVM or Hedera format)
   - Confirm you're connected to Hedera Testnet in your wallet
   - Check if the contract is actually deployed using HashScan
   - Try alternative address formats (convert between EVM and Hedera format)

2. **Function Execution Failures**
   - Review parameter types and ensure they match the function signature
   - Check if you have sufficient HBAR for gas fees
   - Verify contract state prerequisites for the function
   - Look for revert reasons in the transaction receipt
   - Check function access controls (onlyOwner, etc.)

3. **ABI Loading Issues**
   - Try uploading a custom ABI if automatic detection fails
   - Use verified source code from HashScan if available
   - Check if the contract was deployed with a flattened source
   - Verify the contract has been verified on the network
   - Use bytecode analysis as a fallback for basic functions

4. **Wallet Connection Problems**
   - Ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked
   - Verify you're connected to Hedera Testnet in MetaMask
   - Try refreshing the page and reconnecting
   - Check for browser console errors
   - Clear browser cache if persistent issues occur

## üìö Best Practices for Contract Testing

1. **Systematic Testing Approach**
   - Start with read functions to understand current contract state
   - Test write functions with minimal values first
   - Monitor state changes after each transaction
   - Document unexpected behaviors or errors
   - Create a testing checklist for comprehensive coverage

2. **Security Considerations**
   - Always verify the contract source code before interaction
   - Review function permissions and access controls
   - Check state requirements and invariants
   - Monitor gas usage for potential DoS vectors
   - Be cautious with functions that transfer assets

3. **Optimization Strategies**
   - Batch similar read calls to reduce network overhead
   - Use event listeners efficiently for state updates
   - Cache frequent queries to minimize redundant calls
   - Monitor gas patterns to identify optimization opportunities
   - Use multicall patterns when available

## üîÆ Advanced Usage Techniques

### Contract Verification and Analysis
```javascript
// Verify contract source code
await verifyContract(address);

// Analyze bytecode for security issues
await analyzeBytecode(address);

// Check for known vulnerabilities
await scanVulnerabilities(address);
```

### Custom ABI Integration
```javascript
// Upload and validate custom ABI
await loadCustomABI(address, abiJSON);

// Verify function signatures match bytecode
await validateFunctions(abi);

// Save ABI for future sessions
await saveABI(address, abi);
```

### State Monitoring and Comparison
```javascript
// Monitor specific storage slots
await watchStorage(contractAddress, slot);

// Track state changes between transactions
const stateBefore = await getContractState(address);
await executeTransaction(address, functionName, params);
const stateAfter = await getContractState(address);
await compareState(stateBefore, stateAfter);
```

## üéØ Real-world Examples

### Basic Token Interaction
```javascript
// Query token balance
const balance = await tokenContract.balanceOf(accountAddress);

// Transfer tokens
await tokenContract.transfer(recipientAddress, amount);

// Check allowance
const allowance = await tokenContract.allowance(ownerAddress, spenderAddress);
```

### NFT Contract Interaction
```javascript
// Mint new NFT
await nftContract.mint(recipientAddress, tokenURI);

// Query token owner
const owner = await nftContract.ownerOf(tokenId);

// Get token metadata
const uri = await nftContract.tokenURI(tokenId);
```

### DeFi Protocol Interaction
```javascript
// Provide liquidity
await liquidityPool.addLiquidity(tokenA, tokenB, amountA, amountB, minA, minB);

// Swap tokens
await router.swapExactTokensForTokens(amountIn, minAmountOut, path, recipient, deadline);

// Check reserves
const [reserve0, reserve1] = await pair.getReserves();
```

## üìà Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Multiple Read Operations**
   - Use multicall patterns to combine multiple read operations into a single request
   - Reduces network overhead and improves response times

2. **Implement Efficient Gas Management**
   - Monitor gas usage patterns across different functions
   - Adjust gas limits based on historical transaction data
   - Use gas price oracles for optimal pricing

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive try/catch blocks
   - Decode error messages from reverted transactions
   - Provide clear user feedback for failed operations

4. **Strategic Data Caching**
   - Cache frequent queries with appropriate invalidation strategies
   - Store historical data locally to reduce redundant network calls
   - Implement time-based cache expiration for dynamic data

5. **Optimize Event Listening**
   - Use specific event filters instead of broad listeners
   - Implement pagination for historical event queries
   - Process events in batches for better performance
