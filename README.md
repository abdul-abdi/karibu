   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## 🔧 Application Workflow

Karibu provides an end-to-end workflow for smart contract development:

1. **Create or Upload** - Write Solidity code in our editor or upload existing files
2. **Compile & Analyze** - Automated compilation and security analysis
3. **Deploy to Testnet** - One-click deployment to supported testnets
4. **Interact & Verify** - Call functions and view results in real-time with our universal interface

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Creating a Smart Contract

1. Navigate to the "Create" page
2. Choose between Simple Editor and Advanced IDE modes:
   - **Simple Editor**: Write a single Solidity file or choose from templates
   - **Advanced IDE**: Develop multi-file projects with dependencies
3. Save your contract when finished

### Using the Advanced Multi-File IDE

1. Click "Switch to Advanced IDE" from the Create page
2. Create files and folders with the "New" button
3. Organize your project structure:
   - Create contract interfaces in separate files
   - Import libraries and dependencies
   - Manage project organization with folders
4. External libraries like OpenZeppelin are automatically detected and linked
5. Files with dependencies are compiled together

### Using Contract Templates

1. Navigate to the "Templates" page
2. Browse templates by category (Tokens, NFTs, DeFi, Governance, Utility)
3. Click on a template card to:
   - View detailed description
   - See use cases and technical specifications
   - Examine the implementation code
4. Use the "View Details" button to access comprehensive information about any template
5. Click "Use Template" to load it directly into the editor
6. Templates are loaded into the custom contract editor for immediate customization

### Analyzing a Contract

1. On the contract creation page, click "Analyze"
2. Review security insights and optimization suggestions
3. Make any necessary modifications based on recommendations

### Deploying a Contract

1. From the editor, click "Deploy"
2. Enter any constructor arguments if required
3. Click "Deploy to Testnet"
4. View deployment status and contract address when complete

### Interacting with Contracts

1. Navigate to the "Interact" page and enter your contract address
2. Our system automatically detects available functions through bytecode analysis
3. View live contract state and storage values through our dynamic interface
4. Select functions to call from the interface
5. For read functions, results will display immediately
6. For write functions, transaction details will be shown

### Using the AI Assistant

1. Click the AI Assistant chat button in the bottom-right corner
2. Ask questions about blockchain concepts, Solidity, or how to use Karibu
3. Get instant, contextual help while you develop
