# Blockchain Network Extension Project

## Background and Motivation
The current application works with Hedera Testnet, but needs to be extended to support multiple Ethereum testnets. This requires making the codebase more dynamic and less hardcoded to handle different network configurations.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
After reviewing the codebase, I've identified several areas that need modification to support Ethereum testnets:

1. **Network Configuration**: Currently, the application is hardcoded to use Hedera Testnet with specific endpoints:
   - `HASHIO_API_ENDPOINT = 'https://testnet.hashio.io/api'` for JSON-RPC calls
   - `MIRROR_NODE_TESTNET = 'https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1'` for API calls
   - Hedera-specific environment variables: `HEDERA_OPERATOR_ID`, `HEDERA_OPERATOR_KEY`

2. **Blockchain SDK Usage**: The application uses the Hedera SDK (`@hashgraph/sdk`) for blockchain interactions, which is specific to Hedera.
   - For Ethereum, we'll need to use `ethers.js` or `web3.js` instead
   - Transaction creation, signing, and sending are different between networks

3. **Address Format Conversion**: The app has extensive logic to convert between Hedera's native format (0.0.X) and EVM addresses.
   - This won't be needed for pure Ethereum networks, but a common address format handler will be useful

4. **Contract Deployment and Interaction**: The deployment and interaction logic is currently Hedera-specific.
   - `ContractCreateFlow`, `ContractCallQuery`, and other Hedera-specific classes are used
   - Gas estimation and transaction parameters will need to be adapted for Ethereum networks

5. **Mirror Node API Calls**: The app uses Hedera's Mirror Node API for contract information.
   - Ethereum networks use different endpoints and structures for similar data

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- I've successfully refactored the verify-function route to use the network adapter pattern.
- The verification process has been enhanced to try two approaches:
  1. Checking for the function selector in the bytecode (primary method)
  2. Attempting to call the function directly for view/pure functions (secondary verification method)
- This dual approach increases the accuracy of function detection, especially for proxy contracts or other complex cases.
- Next, I'll tackle the compilation-related routes (compile and compile-multi).
- Each refactored route now includes the network ID and name in the response for better client-side handling.

## Lessons
- The application currently has Hedera-specific code throughout the codebase, making it challenging to add support for other networks.
- A proper abstraction layer will make it easier to add more networks in the future.
- We need to maintain backward compatibility with existing Hedera functionality while adding Ethereum support.
- When working with ethers.js, it's important to check the version being used as there are significant API differences between v5 and v6.
- The Hedera SDK's ContractFunctionParameters has a method _build() that needs to be called before passing to setFunctionParameters or setConstructorParameters in newer versions of the SDK.
- When refactoring routes, we need to carefully handle network-specific types and response formats to ensure consistency.
